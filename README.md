# JavaScript Maps and Sets

## Maps

Like objects:

- both contain key-value pairs
- both allow get, set and delete key-value pairs

Key difference:

- Map does not contain default keys: thy must be set
- Map key can be any values, not string only
- Map has size property
- Map does not allow duplicate keys
